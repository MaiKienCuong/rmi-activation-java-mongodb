{"_id":{"$numberLong":"158"},"newsContent":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059749/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Spy Who Came In From The Cold\u003c/a\u003e is one of my all time favorite movies, and I've seen it half a dozen times by now, but there's one part that always seemed a little sketchy.  At the end of the movie, Leamas is let out of his cell by Mundt and provided with a car.  Mundt also lets Leamas' lover, Nan, escape with him.  Mundt knows, however, that Leamas is going to tell Nan everything, which is why he has the boy shoot her as she and Leamas are climbing over the wall.  When Leamas sees that Nan has been shot, he decides that he doesn't want to go on living without her, climbs back to the East German side, and gets shot.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was Nan released in the first place, however?  Leamas seems to believe, in his final monologue, that it was part of a deal, and that Mundt believed that he wouldn't leave without her, a belief that is justified in the last minute of the film.  But it seems to me that Leamas would be more likely to accept life as a Nan-less spy if she was ditched in East Germany than if she was shot by a fellow British agent.  Furthermore, a more convincing argument for his return could have been made by Mundt at the gate than the one Smiley and the boy attempt to make in the last lines of the film.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt would also have been better for Mundt to keep Nan in East Germany, because it makes the escape less suspicious.  The Soviets will easily believe that Fiedler's co-conspirators helped Leamas escape, because Leamas was working for them and they owed it to him, and the official explanation is that Leamas and Fiedler were working together to incriminate Mundt, so it makes sense that Fiedler's friends would help him escape.  What makes less sense, however, is Fiedler's friends helping Nan escape - they owe nothing to her, and Nan was the girl who unraveled their entire plot.  They have no motive for saving her other than that Leamas wants them to, and that motive is non-consequential enough that the story Mundt will provide would make sense without letting Nan go.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo why was Nan let go?

In a somewhat unorthodox fashion, however, many of the original actors/actresses that Andy crossed paths with were called back to assist with the re-creation of those very same scenes. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo, aside from the obvious amount of time that has passed (the actors and actresses clearly all look a bit older) the scenes are more-or-less exact replicas of what happened in Andy's past.

There are most certainly some actors that weren't able to reprise their roles, for various reasons (the scene wasn't important enough, the original actor wasn't available/dead/etc), but there was one key actor missing who could have reprised his role--for a very significant scene: Michael Richards, in \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xqiCeIFws\"\u003ethe \"Friday's\" incident\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBack in '81, Andy appeared on a live sketch comedy show which attempted to take advantage of the success of Saturday Night Live. It was comprised of young comedians getting their start in the industry, and performing sketches on live TV, much in the same fashion as SNL. On one particular night, a sketch involving four friends (one of which was played by Andy Kaufman, another by Michael Richards) took place at a restaurant, with the joke being that they would get up at various times and head to the bathroom to smoke marijuana. About half-way through this sketch, Kaufman decided for whatever reason to go off script, infuriating and frustrating his fellow cast members. At one point, Richards goes off camera and returns with the sketch's cue cards, and tosses them on the table in front of Kaufman, at which point Kaufman sprays Richards with a glass of water, causing even more friction, and an eventual fight breaks out between Kaufman and Friday's co-producer Jack Burns.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAndy was known for unconventional humor. Throughout his career, he made a lot of judgment calls about what he thought was true comedy, but that not very many other people seemed to agree on. One recurring theme in his comedy was that \u003cstrong\u003ehe liked to keep the audience guessing\u003c/strong\u003e. Was what we were seeing really real? Or was it all an elaborate hoax? A staged event that really truly seems like it is actually happening, only to find out later that it was a sham from the start. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eMany people that Kaufman staged these \"events\" with now confirm today that they were, in fact, staged; the most famous of which could be considered the entire series of events that took place between wrestler Jerry Lawler and Kaufman.

It seems loosely that cast (in order of today's \"big name\" significance), directors and financiers get the front spots, and everything else appears later.

But, as I said, my main curiosity is about actor credits.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, there is little indication of which characters the core cast actors play.  Sometimes their name is edited to appear along with an image of the character as an indictator, but sometimes there is no indication.  As I've never seen anyone credited in both the opening and closing credits, that leaves the potential for core actors to never be directly associated with their character.  This seems potentially problematic; is there a reason for this?  Are viewers expected to know who's who?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eGuest actors sometimes are simply credited by name (and not being part of the opening video, this means they will never be associated with their character in credits).  But often they are credited as \"\u003cstrong\u003especial guest\u003c/strong\u003e as \u003cstrong\u003echaracter name\u003c/strong\u003e\".  This is quite helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing I find really confusing is, sometimes the last few regular cast actors will get the guest actor treatment.  I've seen opening video with \"and \u003cstrong\u003eactor\u003c/strong\u003e as \u003cstrong\u003echaracter\u003c/strong\u003e\" paired with an image of that character for an entire season.  Why does this actor get special treatment?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, sometimes guest actors will be credited at the front following the opening video, sometimes they'll be credited in the closing credits.  Are there rules for deciding who get's credited early or late?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI've sometimes wondered if shows deliberately play with actor's name position to obfuscate plot arcs (\"you won't think we're killing of this character if their actor is still in the opening credits\", or \"you won't expect this recurring guest if we place their name in the closing credits\") and I've also wondered if there are thresholds for \"people appearing in XX number or YY percentage of episodes get placed \u003cstrong\u003ehere\u003c/strong\u003e.\"  But it's difficult to build a good sampling base for this.

They say that it the man smokes again, they'll put his wife into that cage, if it happens again, his daughter, and if it happens yet again, they'll send someone to rape his wife. To the question of what happens if he smokes yet again afterwards, he opened his jacket, but I couldn't recognize what was inside; it must have been something that answered the question.

At the end of each episode, everything that had happened was completely and forgotten, and the show effectively \"reset\" for the next episode.

Marla is self-destructive, manipulative, and a kleptomaniac.

The waiter may be attempting to allude to the fact that Jack isn't the same person as he is during Fight Club.

It is very clearly established that he does not like Zeus, at all. But Zeus seems happily oblivious; he's glad his brother is there, he jokes around with him, tells him he should stay at the party longer and not work so hard. So we've established, then, that Hades does not like Zeus at all, but that Zeus doesn't know this, and however often they see each other, he likes his brother and thinks they have a good enough relationship to invite him to the celebration of his son's birth.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFast-forward to the scene on Mt.

Olympus (so, all except Hades) now know that Hercules has been found, and Zeus and Hera watch baby Hercules with his new mortal parents, and are sad that he can't come back to Mt.

He's just had a baby, and a huge party celebrating that baby's birth where he invited his brother and tried to get him to stick around longer. If you have a brother who you care enough about to make jokes and invite him to the baby's party etc.... Then you're going to go visit that brother and tell him in person that your baby has been kidnapped and lost his immortality, and that you've lost your only chance to ever raise your son.
